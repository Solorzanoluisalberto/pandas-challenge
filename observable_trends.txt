Description of observable trends based on the data.
I perceive the following from the PyCitySchools dataset:
1) Of the 15 schools presented and distributing them by size, according to number of students, medium schools (1000-2000) and small (<1000), have better academic performance in both mathematics and reading, being above 84%
2) Grouping the data by% overall passing, we note that in the main 5 schools, 100% of them are Charter type, suggesting this type of schools may be a better option for parents looking for a school for their children
